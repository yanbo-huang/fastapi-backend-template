### How to run everything?

```shell
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Now, you have a local Postgresql database and a FastApi APP running.

Navigate to `localhost:8080/docs`, you will have a Open-API page ready.
![open api page](./docs/fastapi-page.png)

> The template creates a few two example entities, `User` and `Blog`, to help you start.

- **users**: you can create a user and fetch all users
- Click the `Authorize` button to login with the user-name and password you just created by the `users` endpoint.
- **blogs**: user you create a blog for the current user and fetch blogs created for the active user.

Now, you have everything ready and running,


If you prefer to just run the API locally, you can follow the next steps.

pipx install poetry
```

```shell
poetry install
```

- Start a local database

```shell
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build db
```

- Run database migrations

```shell
alembic upgrade head
```


- Start your FastApi APP
```shell
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
